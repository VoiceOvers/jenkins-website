Jenkins Cloud Implementation
================

Starting Instructions:

1. Clone the Repo
2. Go to command line in root of project, Run Command: npm install
3. Run Command: bower install (If it doesn't work because of permissions
you will have to run as root: sudo bower install --allow-root)
4. To start server in dev mode, Run command: gulp default

Server should be started in Development mode at this point, meaning that any changes you
make to files in the server/client directory will automatically redeploy all necessary changes.
